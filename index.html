		<b>Gwen</b><br><br>
		Always dresses in goth fashion though despite her fashion, she confidently shows a kind personality (especially in the later seasons). She rivals with Heather as Heather always finds every opportunity to sabotage her. She is extremely cautious as to whom she lets into her life.

		<b>Trent</b><br><br>
		The dreamy guitar boy of the show. He possesses romantic feelings for Gwen (which she returns for the first 2 seaons). He was shown to have an addiction to the number 9 which Duncan created a rumor saying it was because it added to the letters of "Gwen" and "Trent", which was not the truth but caused his elimination.<br>

		<b>Courtney</b><br><br>
		She is an extremely high achiever. Initially had a very professional personality as a student lawyer. In later seasons, she would shift to becoming more agnostic, threatening Chris (the host) that she would sue him whenever her needs aren't met. She shows interest in Duncan at first but slowly starts breaking away after World Tour.<br>

		<b>Alejandro</b><br><br>
		He would prove to be a strong contestant despite competing with more experienced contestants in the show. He uses his charm to attract the female contestants, evetually leading to their eliminations. His top target would be Heather, though he would struggle as he had formed romantic feelings for her. <br>
